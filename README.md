# Predicting Cognition after STN DBS Surgery in Parkinson's Disease

This project aims to describe long-term changes in global cognitive ability of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated via bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nuclei (STN) as a function of time (the "descriptive" or "time only" portion of the manuscript) as well as a function of time and more granular pre-surgery cognitive profile (the "predictive" or "factor scores" portion of the manuscript).

The data that support findings of this study are not publicly available due institutional regulations protecting patient clinical information but are available from the me on request (may require data use agreements to be developed). I will gladly welcome anyone to the lab and let them cruise through the data and models. Where possible, I shared analysis code, model posteriors, and synthetic data (I could have missed some opportunities for transparency though, if you have ideas how to make the project more open, let me know).

The [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) was used to create reproducible environment for the project. To set-up R environment for reproduction of our results, run:

`install.packages("renv")`
`renv::restore()`
